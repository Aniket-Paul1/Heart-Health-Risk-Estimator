# ðŸ«€ Heart Disease Predictor

A Machine Learning web app built using Streamlit to predict the likelihood of heart disease in a patient based on various health parameters. This project utilizes models like Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest with data processing and visualization using pandas, numpy, and plotly.
